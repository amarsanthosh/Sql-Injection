we can obtain the Number of columns in a table by two ways
    1. By using UNION
    2. By using ORDER BY 

1. payload --> ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL --
    (if the number is columns is 3 then the page will load correctly, else error... 
    we need to increment the NULL iteratively if we get error.
    no of NULL = no of columns we are assuming)

2. payload --> ' ORDER BY 1 --
    (if there is column 1 , it will be ordered in ascending order,
    ORDER BY 2, if there is 2nd column,it will be ordered in ascending ordered,
    we need to increment the value Iteratively, until error occurs,
    if error occurs on ORDER BY 4, then there is 3 number of columns)
