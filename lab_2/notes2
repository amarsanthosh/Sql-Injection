The Solution is simple
        username -> administrator' --
        password -> anyrandom

The work is in automating it :
    -> it generates a csrf token for every Session
    -> 1st we need to create a Session and get the csrf token
    -> Then to parse the response we use "BeautifulSoup"
    -> after that we need to send the Post request
    -> need to create a dictionory to match the fields of the csrf {csrf, username , password}
    -> Finally check it by valuating if "Log out" is in response or not.
